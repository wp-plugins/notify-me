* Version: 1.0

This Plugin is used to get back old behaviour of wordpress. Prior to WP 3.1 there was an email notification when a comment was approved. This notification
was removed in WP 3.1, so I wrote this plugin which brings back that notification.

Simply upload the plugin to your plugins directory and activate it. There is no need to do further stuff.

Have fun!
